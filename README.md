### Credit
As I lack webdevelopment experience I took some ideas from [webcoded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb1f5bvF6f4&t=4985s&ab_channel=webdecoded)
#### Thoughts
- Front End is difficult when you dont have a UI/UX Designer
- I don't like how githubs links are done the opposite way to Obsidian
- Organisation of Files could have been done better
- TailwindCSS is awesome
